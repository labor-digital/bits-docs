        // update all other bit mounts it meets along the way. This means that all your parent
        // nodes will also rebind their data.
        
        // Super-Pro tip: You can listen for a "domChange" either using a event listener with this.$on('domChange'),
        // or by using the domChanged() lifecycle hook
